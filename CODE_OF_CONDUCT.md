# Restalo Code of conduct

## Our pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our collective
and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age,
body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and
expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality,
personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

*   Using welcoming and inclusive language
*   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
*   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
*   Focusing on what is best for the community
*   Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
    advances
*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
*   Public or private harassment
*   Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic
    address, without explicit permission
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
    professional setting

## Our responsibilities

The Restalo project maintainers are responsible for the clarity of the information they provide
and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to
any instances of unacceptable behavior.

The Restalo project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this code of conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any
contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.

Three strikes will be given to any contributor who does not follow the code of
conduct, with the third strike resulting in a permanent ban from the community.

## Scope

Since there is no physical event linked to the project Restalo, the code of conduct will
apply to all interactions between members of the community, including but not
limited to:

* The use of the project’s code repositories
* The use of the project’s communication channels
